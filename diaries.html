									<h1>This Is All<br />
									what Now?</h1>
									<p>What on Octogar was I thinking?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Perhaps it's a bit strange and maybe rude to say this, but most of my design stems from deceit.</p>
								<p>A misguided goal? Perhaps, but as much as I love a turn order auction, and Age of Steam and The Great Zimbabwe by proxy, I neither have had the playgroup nor the proper context to play these tight if dry games.
									What I would love is to meet them in the middle. I want to take these less direct mechanisms and put them in a more thematic a little more random and a little more chaotic package to make the medicine go down so to say.
									I think of games like Cosmic Encounter and Tigris and Euphrates. Two games that have complicated strategy, but a bit of a rough charm to them that gets them to the table.</p>
								<p>What I'm saying is that I want to trick my friends into playing Horseless Carraige.</p>
								<h2>The Year is 2023</h2>
								<p>And I'm doing a kinda crazy challenge to make a game <a>every month in twenty four hours.</a> While this is going on, Samuel Vrizen's <a>strategy notes on Horseless Carriage</a> has been rattling around my head which had been like catnip for my Cole Wehrle paxaholic brain.
									The idea of this push and pull in this marketplace of ideas leading to these sprawling factory layouts excited me.</p>
								<p>I think it's also important to know that I had never actually played Horseless Carriage while initially designing this game. I was going purely on my assumptions on what I thought the game was. (as well as some judicious lifting from the rulebook)
									Another guiding light I had was the fact that most of my other designs leading up to this point were kinda boring demonstrations of procedure. That is, much ink and actions spilled to perform opaque and unsatisfying results.
									I would try to change that with this game. The game jam's theme and time restrictions as well as my own desire to finally make a fun game for once led me to try to make something as punchy as possible.</p>
								<h2>On Writing</h2>
								<p>When it comes to writing games for tabletop game jams, I tend to not worry about making a balanced or hell even functional game. I optimize these things mainly for being read, putting quips and surprising keywords inline with the rules. I know no one's going to cut out a near Splotter level of cardboard pieces or wrangle their friends into interpreting my nonsense. Besides, most games submitted are solo games, a genre I have tried and stumbled at, usually morphing into the multiplayer conflict game I wanted to make in the first place.</p>
								<p>I sit down at my computer and Cole Wehrle starts whispering in my ear. For the first time, I start thinking about the scenes I want to play out in the game.<sup>[1]</sup> I see visions of comets wrecking havoc over cardboard tiles and combat in an economic game. I think of <a>Dan Thurot's review of Autobahn</a> and how he praised its use of a map that is both built and used, but was unfortunately too euroy. I feel Wehrle's guiding hand as I sketch out the first prototype in <a>acclaimed vector graphic design software</a> Affinity Designer.</p>
								<p>I somehow write the rules, create a Tabletop Simulator mod, and make a print and play copy all in the twenty four hours. To this day, I wonder where the energy came from. I tell some friends about it. One said how cool it would be if it were a roll and write. I smile at the suggestion and nod in the other direction. But after making all these, I do some self playtesting at the eleventh hour, moving the pieces around to make sure nothing ignites. This sort of playtesting usually exhausts me and exacerbates the issue of optimizing for procedure<sup>[2]</sup>, so it's a terrible way for me to find the fun, but I arrive at some form of satisfaction, submit it to BGG, and shelve it.</p>
								<h2>The Year is 2024</h2>
								<p>And including myself and my friends, I have still never met a person who has played Horseless Carriage in real life. At this point, I'm fuzzy on the next order of things. I don't remember whether me pulling off the prototype in its Root Riverfolk expansion box off the top shelf came first or if it were me learning about the Indie Games Night Market. I do not remember the exact point I start thinking about believing in the game again.</p>
								<p>But what I do remember is that on X X, 2024, my friends organize a board game hangout. I spend the night before sanding down the more annoying edges, but keep the baroque phases that have been a growing pain on me. I get to the hangout the next day a little bit late and watch them play City of the Great Machine. When that wraps up, I spring the game on them.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

								<h3>Footnotes</h3>
								<p>[1]. I remember seeing a video game development where a game designer and narrative designer are arguing over game vs mechanisms first. After applying this 'scene based design' I think they are both fools, but what I know. I develop these things alone and have had total creative control over my projects, so perhaps I'm more toxic than I actually know.</p>
								<p>[2]. There was an essay about theorists vs. business people I read once that talked about how buisness people desire simplicity while theorists hope for an appropriate amount of complexity in their work. That the best way to upset a theorist is to tell them their work is 'simple' and 'surface level.' I find I mirror these fears a bit when I do self playtesting. Every time I feel bored, I add another three rules.</p>
								<p>[3]. Some discord folks know I do this there too. It's a nasty habit I need to get rid of.</p>
